Download the file and extract localy.
Open a terminal in the folder (or just ```cd``` to it)

And execute

You can also compile the game from sources using the Crystal compiler

## To-Do list

* More stroy
* A way to staticlly link the binery and get rid of the /ext/ folder
* Get help with building on Ubutnu (some one who dont care to compile the game and upload the binery back)
* Feed-back !

Enjoy !
